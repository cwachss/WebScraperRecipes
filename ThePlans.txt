xl spreadsheet with ingredients and amounts in pantry
dictionary of conversions- one bag of flour = x number of cups, etc
but not if we stop caring about amounts because us rich americans always have excessive amounts
maybe, but probably not: store information in a dictionary called pantry, in which ingredients are defined by amount
method to update pantry after making a recipe
find recipe:
enter recipe you want to make
web scraper builds url (allrecipes.com/search=thing+i+am+searching) so input thing ex "chocolate chip cookies"
optional: enter how much time you have or how many servings you want
and program scrapes webpage allrecipes.com/search=chocolate+chip+cookies
click on each link and find the ingredients list.
compare ingredients to what is in pantry and amounts (if we get around to it, also match the time/servings)
if it's a match, store its information in something (recipe object? dictionary?)
margarine and butter are considered equal.
generate pdf of the first two matches each as a separate pdf, so you can pick which one.
If no matches found, suggest closest match. so store also a recipe called "closest" and
update it as you find a recipe that is a closer match. tell user what ingredients they need to acquire
maybe skip the amounts - the more I think about it, the more complicated it gets. I would need a huge dictionary
defining all possible conversions. To be fair someone definitely made one already but implementing would still be a pain
I'd rather focus on ingredient matching unfortunately I'm not making some brilliant machine learning project, so we'll
stick to common names for ingredients, not all possible names. we'll deal with separated eggs, different names for
powdered sugar, ignore types of flour because you can substitute, and equate butter and margarine
